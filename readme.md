Streaming:
I reccomend using Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) because of its stability and lightweight installation.
You could also try out FFSPLIT which is easier to set up, but i personally find it too unstable.
If you need help setting up your streaming program, i reccomend you head on over to http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/topics/358640-broadcast-hardware-and-software/articles
